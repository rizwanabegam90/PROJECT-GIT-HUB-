## Future Scope

1. **Secondary Market for Tickets**:
   - Implement a marketplace for users to buy and sell event tickets securely, ensuring valid ownership.

2. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   - Add support for dynamic ticket pricing based on demand and proximity to the event date.

3. **Ticket Validation**:
   - Introduce a system for event organizers to validate tickets at the event entry, ensuring authenticity.

The **EventTicketing** contract enhances event management by allowing decentralized ticket issuance and secure transfers, ensuring transparency and trust for both organizers and attendees.
